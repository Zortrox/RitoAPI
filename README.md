# Much Brawlers

This project was created for the [**The Riot Games API Challenge 2.0**](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/2lxEyIcE).  Our aim was to create a website that analyzed champion statistics throughout a 24 hour period and determined the win and pick rate for each champion at specific 30 minute intervals.  We also display the buy and win rate of each brawler as well as the percentages of those that didn't buy a brawler at all.

We also calculated the win rate of champions whether they bought the new Black Market items or not.  We display that information in addition to the pick, ban, and untouched rates as well as the highest/average kills, deaths, assists, gold earned, minion kills, tower kills, and wards placed on each champion's individual page.

The final page shows some miscellaneous "other" data: a death heatmap, number of twenty-minute surrenders, number of less than 20 minute games, number of total Teemo deaths, and a funny "50% Global Win Rate" (for every win, somebody else loses).
