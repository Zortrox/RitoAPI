#Brawler Data Load

This tool is the backbone of the projects data analysis. It allows us to load all of the match data into our custom database structure, and query the database for information to be displayed on the webpage.
It is designed to use multithreading as much as possible to compensate for the large amounts of data it will be loading/storing at any given time.
