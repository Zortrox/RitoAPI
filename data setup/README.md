#Data Setup

This section includes all of the tools and procedures we used to acquire, 
format, store, and analyze all of the different data for our project.
The steps we used are as follows:

1. Use the [API Grabber Tool] (https://github.com/Zortrox/RitoAPI/tree/master/data%20setup/APIGrabber) to download and organized the 100,000 different match files from Riot API.
2. Create the database table structure to store our data 
3. Use the [Brawler Data Load Tool](https://github.com/Zortrox/RitoAPI/tree/master/data%20setup/BrawlerDataLoad) to save the data to our database structure
4. Use the Brawler Data Load Tool to analyze our database using various [Stored Procedures](https://github.com/Zortrox/RitoAPI/tree/master/data%20setup/Database/Stored%20Procedures) and [Functions] (https://github.com/Zortrox/RitoAPI/tree/master/data%20setup/Database/Functions).
